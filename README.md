Understanding OOPS concepts
//how state and behavior are represented with in a object
        //oops is  a method of programming based on a hierarcy of classes and well defined
        //objects -> the entities cobine data and behavour
        //4 fundamental principles of oop -encapsulation,abstraction,inheritence,and polymorphism
        //encapsulation -> internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside view
        //abstraction -> simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to problrm
        //inheritance -> allows one class to inherit the properties and method of another
        //ploymorphism -> enables  a single inheritace to reprsent diff forms
        // data(varaiables) + code(methods) -> single unit called class -> encapsulation
        //
