Understanding OOPS concepts
//how state and behavior are represented with in a object
        //oops is  a method of programming based on a hierarcy of classes and well defined
        //objects -> the entities cobine data and behavour
        //4 fundamental principles of oop -encapsulation,abstraction,inheritence,and polymorphism
        //encapsulation -> internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside view
        //abstraction -> simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to problrm
        //acheived using abstract classes and interfaces .cannot be instatntiated .the idea is to provide a base cass that defines the structure and capabilites of its subclasses . subclasses provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods 
        //benefits -> simplicity ,modularity ,reusability,flexibility and scalability 
        //interface-> An interface is a completely astract class that is used to group related methods with empty bodies . 
        //inheritance -> allows one class to inherit the properties and method of another
        //ploymorphism -> enables  a single inheritace to reprsent diff forms
        // data(varaiables) + code(methods) -> single unit called class -> encapsulation
        //polymorphism adds the flexibility and reusability to the code . it allows to one interface and multiple 
        //implementations . key concepts used in real life world , such as method callbacks, event handling and interface driven designs .
        //encapsulation -> refers to bundling of data(attributes ) and methods that operate on this data into a single unit or class . moreover it is about restricting direct access to some of an objects components , which eans of preventing accidental intefrence and misuse of the methods and data
        // it comes as data hiding acheived by paccess modifiers : public ,protected and default , private and getters and setters , we can control how the fields are accessed and modified.
